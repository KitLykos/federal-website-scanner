## üîß Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required software
Node.js >= 16.0.0
npm >= 8.0.0
git
```

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/federal-website-scanner.git
cd federal-website-scanner

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Validate configuration
npm run config

# Test with a small dataset
MAX_URLS_PER_DOMAIN=5 npm run validate
```

## üìã Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style
- Use modern ES6+ features where appropriate
- Follow existing code formatting and patterns
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions

### Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Validates a list of government URLs for accessibility scanning
 * @param {Array<string>} urls - URLs to validate
 * @param {number} maxUrls - Maximum number of URLs to process
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Validation results with valid/invalid URLs
 */
async function validateGovernmentUrls(urls, maxUrls = 100) {
  // Implementation here
}
```

### Configuration
- Use environment variables for user-configurable options
- Provide sensible defaults in `config.js`
- Document all configuration options

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with appropriate detail level
- Gracefully handle government site quirks (rate limiting, redirects, etc.)

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Before Submitting
```bash
# Run basic validation
npm run validate

# Test configuration loading
npm run config

# Test job generation
npm run generate-jobs

# Check for common issues
node --check *.js
```

### Testing with Government Sites
- Test with a variety of federal domains
- Respect rate limiting and server load
- Use small datasets during development
- Test timeout and error recovery scenarios

### Test Data
- Use only publicly accessible government URLs
- Do not include sensitive or internal URLs
- Prefer sites known to be stable and accessible

## üìù Pull Request Process

### 1. Prepare Your Changes
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# ... code changes ...

# Test thoroughly
npm run validate

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description

Detailed explanation of the changes, why they were made,
and any potential impacts or considerations."
```

### 2. Submit Pull Request

- Maintain example configurations

### Changelog
- Document breaking changes
- Explain new features
- Credit contributors

## üêõ Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Enable debug logging
DEBUG=true npm run validate

# Test with minimal configuration
MAX_URLS_PER_DOMAIN=1 npm run validate

# Check specific agency
AGENCY_NAME=education npm run generate-jobs
```
